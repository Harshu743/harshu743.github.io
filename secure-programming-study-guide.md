# Principles of Secure Programming: Comprehensive Study Guide

## I. Introduction to IT Application and Data Security

### A. Security Goals

- **Authentication**: Verifying someone's identity.  
  - **Methods**: Passwords, biometrics (palm scan, iris scan, retinal scan, fingerprinting, voice identification, facial recognition, signature dynamics), multi-factor authentication (MFA).  
  - **Types**: Two-factor authentication (something you know + something you have/are), Mutual Authentication (client and server verify each other).

- **Authorization**: Checking if a user has permission to conduct an action (e.g., Access Control List - ACL).

- **Confidentiality**: Keeping data secret from unauthorized access and disclosure.  
  - **Techniques**: Data Encryption, Access Control, Secure Communication Protocols (TLS, SSL), Data Masking, Firewalls, Anti-Malware Software, Regular Audits and Monitoring.

- **Data/Message Integrity**: Ensuring data is trustworthy, accurate, and protected from unauthorized changes.  
  - **Techniques**: Data Validation and Sanitization, Cryptographic Hash Functions, Digital Signatures, Access Controls, Audit Trails, Secure Communication Protocols, Error Detection and Handling, Version Control, Regular Backups, Message Authentication Codes (MACs).

- **Availability**: Ensuring systems and data are accessible to authorized users when needed.  
  - **Techniques**: Redundancy and Failover Systems, Load Balancing, Regular System Updates and Maintenance, Disaster Recovery Plans, Backups, Network Security Measures (DDoS protection), Monitoring and Alerting Systems, Resource Management, Quality of Service (QoS) Controls, Scalability, Employee Training and Awareness.

- **Accountability**: Tracing actions within a system back to responsible entities.  
  - **Techniques**: Authentication, Logging, Audit Trails.

- **Non-Repudiation**: Ensuring actions or transactions cannot be denied after they have occurred.  
  - **Techniques**: Digital signatures, audit trails, Trusted Third Party (Trent), Key Management, Timestamping and Logging, Verification of Signatures, Dispute Resolution, Archiving.
